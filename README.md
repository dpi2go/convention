# IoT-Router Requirements
Joint creation of a requirements convention for an affordable mobile IoT Internet router and for hosting IoT agents for Smart Home and other third-party applications to create synergies between industries and projects.

## Introduction

This document is a requirement specification for a hosting router device to run consumer IoT applications, like Smart Home Gateway Clients and other 3rd party apps, in a virtual environment, e.g. container (isolated namespace), on it. A Smart Home Client is a well known part of a gateway based Smart Home platform. More clients and agents will follow step by step.

**Main ideas**

- One box for multiple applications in a secure environment.
- All relevant and trendy home automation technologies integrated.
- Powerful mobile broadband connection with LAN dual path option.

**But still extremely affordable!**

To be able to work close to the kernel, but still run 3rd party apps in a completely isolated environment and ensure high portability and security, containers must be used.

The here documents were primarily prepared as a binding supplement to tendering procedures. 

Nevertheless, any industry participant who becomes aware of these documents will be invited to submit an own-initiative offer to its customers, or to have one of its partners submit it, with reference to the documents found here.
