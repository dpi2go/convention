# IoT-Router Requirements
Common requirements for affordable Mobile IoT Routers with "5G NR OR 4G LTE Cat.6 upwards " to host consumer IoT Agents for Smart Home and other 3rd party Apps.

## Introduction

This document is a requirement specification for a hosting router device to run consumer IoT applications, like Smart Home Gateway Clients and other 3rd party apps, in a virtual environment, e.g. container (isolated namespace), on it. A Smart Home Client is a well known part of a gateway based Smart Home platform. More clients and agents will follow step by step.

- **Main idea: One box for several applications! But extremely affordable.** 

To be able to work close to the kernel, but still run 3rd party apps in a completely isolated environment and ensure high portability and security, containers must be used.
